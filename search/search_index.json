Now what?</p> <p>The goal of this step is to enable USB Serial, allowing direct communication between your PC and your Pi Zero 2W. You can then SSH into your Pi locally without any dependencies on Wifi. </p> <p>USB Serial Mode allows you to connect your pi directly to your computer using the second (data) MicroUSB port.  \"Regular\" Mode is the normal configuration where you can plug in a power source, keyboard, and HDMI and use your Pi as normal.  One limitation of USB Serial Mode is that you cannot plug in a keyboard and your computer at the same time since it uses the same physical port. You need either a USB to TTL adapter and use the pins or a USB OTG adapter. </p> <p>This guide is tailored for enabling USB Serial mode as an option to have. This guide will let you switch between USB Serial mode and Regular Mode. It may not suit your usecase. </p> <p>This was tested on Kali Linux, which is based on Debian. Since Raspbian is also based on Debian, it should also work there, but I have not tested it.  </p>"},{"location":"pi-guide/part2/#1-disable-gui","title":"1) Disable GUI","text":"<p>You can change this in <code>raspi-config</code></p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target\nsudo reboot\n</code></pre> <p>To reenable GUI on boot, use raspi-config.</p> <p>To start the GUI in the CLI, run: </p> <pre><code>sudo startx &amp;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"pi-guide/part2/#2-optional-disable-wait-for-network-on-boot","title":"2) (optional) Disable wait for network on boot","text":"<pre><code>sudo systemctl disable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service\nsudo reboot\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"pi-guide/part2/#3-enable-the-getty-communication-service-for-usb-serial","title":"3) Enable the getty communication service for USB serial:","text":"<pre><code>sudo systemctl restart serial-getty@ttyGS0.service\n</code></pre> <p>check if it is running with: </p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl status serial-getty@ttyGS0.service\n</code></pre> <p>It should say enabled in green. </p>"},{"location":"pi-guide/part2/#4-shut-down-the-pi-and-edit-your-cmdlinetxt","title":"4) Shut down the Pi and edit your <code>cmdline.txt</code>:","text":"<p>Change your <code>cmdline.txt</code> to this: </p> <pre><code>console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=fc6ea92b-02 rootfstype=ext4 fsck.repair=yes rootwait modules-load=dwc2,g_serial net.ifnames=0 ds=nocloud cfg80211.ieee80211_regdom=US\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"pi-guide/part2/#5-edit-your-configtxt","title":"5) Edit your <code>config.txt</code>","text":"<p>Add this to the top or bottom of your <code>config.txt</code> and ideally remove the rest of the settings that you don't need.
