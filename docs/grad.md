# Graduate School Advice

By Ayaan Qayyum, 5/10/25

This is my advice on how to get into a graduate school and whether it is
the right fit for you.

## Overview

A graduate school application is arguably a lot more straightforward
than an undergrad application. The purpose of graduate school is to help
you specialize into a particular field or area. Depending on the type of
graduate school that you apply to, it may cost a significant amount of
money for you to attend, or it may be free or you may receive even a
stipend. This will focus on mainly applying for MS/PhD and engineering.
I applied for electrical and computer engineering and will be attending
Columbia for their Master’s of Electrical Engineering. I also got into
Georgia Tech for their MS in Computer Engineering.

If I had to break down all the components of a graduate school
application, I would list it like this: resume, essay, letters of
recommendation, grades, research, and internships. The main things that
you can plan for in the short term rather than the long-term or your
essay and resume. Everything else requires significant care and
attention for long-term planning.

## When to Plan

If you are a freshman in college and your plan is just immediately go
straight into a PhD program or MS program after you graduate at some
other university, then you must start planning early. Try to get into a
research lab and do research and eventually try to get a paper
published. I applied to graduate schools without any papers published
and still got in, but I did have some very interesting projects and
industry experiences, such as private research. You can always do
self-motivated / independent research into a particular fields, but
sometimes you need the structural support of your school to succeed. For
example, in my third year, which was my last year, I enrolled in the
James J. Slade Undergraduate Research Program. This program gave me six
credits of Computer Engineering credits to write a research paper, which
was guaranteed to get published at the symposium. There were structural
aspects of the program that really helped me through it. Such aspects
include being required to check in with a PI (principle investigator)
and having to come up with a research topic in advance.

## Applying to PhD Vs. MS or Both

All of the advice that I received said that you should probably apply to
a PhD program rather than a masters program. This is because a lot of
schools will consider you for funding and if you don’t get funding, as a
PHD student, you will most likely still be considered as a Master’s
program. However, this tends to not be automatic. You typically need to
opt-in to being considered for both a MS and a PhD. Meanwhile, some
schools have you decide between a Master’s and a PhD program, so you
have to be careful. For example, Georgia Tech’s Electrical Engineering
forced me to choose between a masters and a PhD. I chose the masters. I
got in, but they never considered me for funding. I don’t regret
applying, but be sure to learn from my experiences. You must
double-check and do all your research to make sure that you know exactly
which program you’re applying to. Also, start all your applications
early in the web application portal so you know what each program
precisely requires, such as an official or signed transcript. I would
recommend you start your application early, possibly in October or
September. I started all of mine in October, which was a little late.

## Letters of Recommendation

Most schools require three letters of recommendation, but some only
required two. Try to ask letters of recommendation well in advance. It
is better to get letters of recommendation from professors in your field
that you have taken classes with rather than letters from a boss from an
internship for example. You can still get a letter of recommendation
from an internship manager you had, but this internship should be more
focused on research and development. Most people go to graduate school
to do research (PhD), to be a Professor (PhD), or specialize in a
particular field (MS). If these appeal to you, you really need those
professors in your field to really support you.

## Resume

Making sure your resume is top-notch is not as difficult as it seems.
Follow the online templates for graduate school published by Carnegie
Mellon or Harvard or whatnot. Highlight the important things and
highlight the projects that you’ve been working on that is directly
relevant for a master or PhD program.

## Transcript

Possibly the most important yet underrated part of your application,
which will absolutely play a significant portion of your application is
your transcript. Make sure to take hard classes early and do well in
them. Show that you have demonstrated academic success and that you’ll
survive at the rigorous school that you’re applying to. Things are
definitely not easy at graduate school, but with the right support,
things could be great for you. You have to believe in your potential, as
nobody else will believe in yourself more than you will.

## Essay Structure Overview

Regarding your essay, you have to make it very clear your intentions and
what you plan on doing there. Make your research interest very clear
both on your resume and in your essay. You are trying to sell yourself
so they will invest in you. So you have to mark the best things about
yourself. This is not easy, but arguably it is a lot easier than
applying to undergrad because undergrad is a complete mess (at least in
my experiences). A lot of schools will have supplemental essays that
you’ll have to write. Try to answer them to the best of your ability and
be clear and direct.

When writing, consider the type of skills a graduate school is seeing
that you have demonstrated. Such skills include critical thinking,
research, communication, and interpersonal skills. The earlier you can
identify your strengths and weaknesses, the better off you will be.
Explicitly list three situations where you have demonstrated these
skills. Then these form your paragraphs. Don’t start your intro
paragraph, in fact this should be the last thing you write. Don’t lock
yourself into a particular theme. I started with a spreadsheet of how I
demonstrated these skills and went forward with that. Recall that the
purpose of your graduate school essay is to simply demonstrate what
activities you have engaged in, what you learned from them, and how it
relates / reflects to graduate school.

I would say that applying to graduate school generally is a lot more
straightforward than applying to jobs (which is a numbers game), and
more straightforward than applying undergrad (which is idiosyncratic).
You have to ask yourself, why am I applying to graduate school? What is
my goal? What do I hope to get out of it?

## Undergrad Double Major vs Master’s Degree

I advise a lot of the freshman that come to me to plan their four-year
plans to either choose between a Master’s degree or a double major,
since they’re the same amount of credits typically (30). I originally
planned to do a double major / double degree, but since the scholarships
I got from Rutgers had to be renewed every year (with the amounts I
received varying wildly over time), I was convinced to speedrun my
undergraduate degree by finishing it in three years and just do my
Master’s in that extra year. I was supposed to spend four years in
higher education anyway, so I’d rather be more efficient. In ECE, I only
knew three people in my major who could do the same thing. You have to
plan EXTREMELY early, like as early as first semester freshman year to
plan to finish. As time goes on, you lose a lot of flexibility. Same
thing with a double degree.

Since it worked so well for me, I’d recommend everyone rush their
undergraduate degree in three years or less if they are able and skip
doing a double major. It’s usually the same amount of credits anyway,
and the level of the courses typically change as compared to a double
major. For example, you typically have to take more 100-200 level
courses to complete a double major. To do a Master’s degree, you have to
take all 30 credits at the 500 level or above. The rigor is definitely
different, and as an undergrad at Rutgers you have the ability to take
Master’s courses as an undergrad or have Master’s students in your
classes (such courses are called cross-listed). It also helps that a
Master’s degree lets you specialize in your field, but a double major
gives you two introductory looks at two separate fields.

But fundamentally, whatever you may choose, do NOT make the mistake of
choosing your classes before you pick the job you want. The job that you
want should guide the courses you choose to study to give you clarity.
If you have an internship that’s all about building analog circuits and
you want to do that as a career, maybe you want to take more classes on
that topic. Find jobs you find are ideal and pick the classes and major
that will help you be the ideal candidate for that job.

## Credit Load Per Semester as an Undergrad

The standard ECE curriculum at Rutgers recommends no more than 16-17
credits a semester. Just because you can handle more does not mean you
will have a fun time. Aside from my first year at college, I never
completed more than 14 credits a semester. The one semester where I took
18 credits and had three jobs I was so stressed I had to withdraw from a
class. Making the tough decision to withdraw early gave me more time to
focus to my other classes. That’s a big deal! When you have less classes
to worry about, you can spend more time towards each one. And when you
can do that, you have a lot more flexibility on what you can work on on
the side. Since high school, my philosophy has always been that classes
are secondary in your academic pursuits. Your first priority should be
to distinguish yourself from the hundreds of other people taking the
exact same classes as you. In my experience, I tried taking advanced
classes early, and took less classes. Since many Rutgers students
overestimated the time they could commit to each class, the averages of
the classes I took were very low, lowering the bar needed to earn an A
or a B+. The moral of my story is to distinguish yourself from those
around you. I did so by taking less classes and taking advanced classes
early.

## Networking and Seeking Advice

Definitely take the time and actually talk to professors and have them
review your resume, essays, and topics of interest. I must have reached
out to over 15 people for advice, including those who are doing graduate
school right now and professors and Deans at my current university and
those at other universities. The people who admit you for graduate
school is the ECE department (or whatever department you’re applying
for). This is important because for undergraduate they are looking for
well-rounded holistic candidates to enrich their undergrad community.
But for graduate school, they are looking for a focus fit and research
fit. Are you going to be an asset to the university?

## Cold Emailing and Demonstrating Interest

Cold emailing professors is important. This demonstrates interest and
makes you stand out from the other candidates. This especially makes you
stand out and especially works if you’re applying for a PhD program. It
may even work better in as a Master’s student, since the only real
administrative difference between a MS and a PhD student is that a PhD
student works directly under a PI through their funding and are strongly
attached, versus a master student is unattached and essentially can work
for a professor for free. However, MS students tend to be lower quality
than PhD students (from what I’ve heard). So if you demonstrate interest
and catch the eye of a professor, they can bring up your name on your
behalf to the admissions committee and make things easy for you to help
you get admitted. I met with a faculty from the University of Michigan
and they recommended you include your transcript and resume in a cold
email, so if they’re interested in you, they already have more
information on you to investigate further.

## Fee Waivers

A lot of graduate schools are really happy to give you fee waivers. Pay
close attention to any programs or ways you might be able to receive a
fee waiver. For example, at Columbia, I received a few waiver by
visiting an information session, and the fee waiver was automatically
applied after I applied. A lot of people get fee waivers for being women
through the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). I have a friend who
spent $0 on graduate school applications through SWE. I spent more like
$300…

## Conclusion

That’s pretty much all the advice I have to get regarding graduate
school. Fundamentally, try to keep in mind a few things:

1.  Strategically plan early.
2.  Work to always distinguish yourself from other students.
3.  Try to take hard classes early if you can handle it.
4.  Try to do research or internships on the side.
5.  Always, constantly seek advice.
