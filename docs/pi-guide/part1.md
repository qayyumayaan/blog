Part 1/3

This part goes into flashing the Kali Linux image with Raspberry Pi Imager on a Pi Zero 2W. 

## 1) Download Kali Linux from the right place. Do not download the Pi-Tail version. 

[Download Kali Linux for Raspberry Pi](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-arm)


## 2) Download Raspberry Pi Imager

[Download Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

## 3) SD Card
Please ensure your SD card is at least 16 GB and is reasonably fast and recent. 

## 4) Flashing
Please pick the right Raspberry Pi. In this case, we are using a Pi Zero 2W. Be sure to pick the right storage and right image. When asked to apply OS customization settings, set your **Wifi & region, and enable SSH**. This saves a lot of time later. 

## 5) Finishing Up
Once it is done writing, plug it into the Pi. Ideally you should have a USB keyboard and display. You're ready for the next steps!
